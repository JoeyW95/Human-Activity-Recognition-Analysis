# Human Activity Recognition Analysis

This repository contains an R script, run_analysis.R, that analyzes data collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## This is how the script works

1. Load required packages.
2. Read the relevant files into R.
3. Merge the training and test datasets.
4. Extract the mean and standard deviation measurements.
5. Assign descriptive activity names to the activities dataset.
6. Label the dataset with descriptive variable names.
7. Merge subject, activity, and features data.
8. Create a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
9. Write the tidy dataset to a text file.

For more info about the variables, please refer to the CodeBook.md file.
