# Human Activity Recognition Analysis

This repository contains an R script, run_analysis.R, that analyzes data collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## This is how the script works

1. Loads required packages.
2. Reads the relevant files into R.
3. Merges the training and test datasets.
4. Extracts the mean and standard deviation measurements.
5. Assigns descriptive activity names to the activities dataset.
6. Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
7. Merges subject, activity, and features data.
8. Creates a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
9. Writes the tidy dataset to a text file.

For more info about the variables, please refer to the CodeBook.md file.
